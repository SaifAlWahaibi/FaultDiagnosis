## Abstract:

Fault diagnosis (FD) has received attention because of its importance in maintaining safe operations of industrial processes. Recently, modern data-driven FD approaches such as deep learning have shown encouraging performance. Particularly, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an alluring capacity to deal with multivariate time-series data converted into images. Nonetheless, existing CNN techniques focus on capturing local correlations. However, global spatiotemporal correlations often prevail in multivariate time-series data from industrial processes. Hence, extracting global correlations using CNNs from such data requires deep architectures that incur many trainable parameters. This paper proposes a novel localâ€“global scale CNN (LGS-CNN) that directly accounts for local and global correlations. Specifically, the proposed network incorporates local correlations through traditional square kernels and global correlations are collected utilizing spatially separated one-dimensional kernels in a unique arrangement. FD performance on the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process dataset validates the proposed LGS-CNN against CNNs, and other state-of-the-art data-driven FD approaches.
